<h3> Resolved: </h3>

<p>A group of concerned Apple shareholders proposes several technical and policy actions 
Apple should take immediately, without waiting to be compelled by shareholders, to quickly earn 
back user trust and demonstrate Apple’s competence in repelling modern threats to user privacy. 
</p>
<p>
We ask that the board enact a policy to use technical methods and other best practices to 
protect user data. Such best practices include: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption: Implement encryption techniques such as Forward Secrecy and the other 
recommended best practices cited in the Electronic Frontier Foundation's recent reports 
on encryption.
</li>
<li>SSL Key Revocation: Revoke and update SSL encryption keys and any similar digital 
entities that may have been compromised, immediately and as often as necessary for the 
security of user data.</li> 
<li>Secure Network Equipment: Remove or replace any equipment that may be used for 
unconstitutional bulk surveillance at sites managed by Apple, to every legally permissible 
extent. Third-party equipment, such as interception devices installed in compliance with 
"pen trap and trace" orders, should provide access to confirm the devices can not be used 
for unconstitutional bulk collection or over-collection of data. If any court order or 
warrant must be withdrawn or revised to achieve this, Apple may seek relief from the 
courts – such as FISC courts that have already discovered systematic over-collection of 
data and ruled some programs unconstitutional – in the course of legally removing such 
equipment.
</li>
<li>
Transparency: Expand deployment of measures such as the “warrant canary” and “dead 
man switch” so users can be confident that Apple networks and encryption keys 
have not been compromised – or can be alerted if they are. 
</li>

<p> Moreover, as a U.S. company Apple has constitutional and ethical duties that include 
respecting the 4th Amendment. 
</p>
<p>
 Apple should, to the full extent permissible by law, deploy its strengths in both 
technology and law to publicly reveal, challenge, reduce, and overturn every government attempt 
at covert surveillance against its customers that doesn't meet these standards: surveillance of 
single, identified individuals under a warrant issued by a neutral judge, particularly describing 
the person and places to be searched, and of limited duration. To the full extent permissible by 
law, Apple should not actively or passively agree to do or allow covert mass surveillance against 
its customers, nor remain silent about what Apple and the government have done or are doing. 
</p>
<p>
Lost trust will not be regained until Apple users and shareholders understand whether 
Apple is a paid participant in unconstitutional bulk surveillance, a hapless victim of it, a gagged 
hostage of government spies, badly in need of help – or, whether Apple is truly an effective foe 
of such surveillance. 
</p>
<p>For stewards of user data like Apple, both ethical standards and user trust are essential to 
sustaining shareholder value. Failing to acknowledge and address these realities can cause the 
company serious ongoing financial harm, particularly in international markets. Conversely, 
by addressing these issues forthrightly Apple can win back the trust of customers, provide 
leadership, offer competitive advantages, and strengthen the entire industry.
